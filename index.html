    <h3>  Early life </h3>
    <p   class="bioTitle">Taurus Tremani Bartlett was born in the Old Town area of Chicago, Illinois,<br>
         to Taurus Bartlett and Stacia Mac. Mac, a former property manager, serves as <br> 
         Bartlett's manager.[8] He grew up in the Marshall Field Garden Apartments, which was <br>
         across from the Cabrini–Green Homes. He is the second of four children, having an <br>
         older sister, a younger brother, Taurean, who's also a rapper under the stage name Trench <br>
         Baby, and a younger sister. After graduating high school, Bartlett was <br>
          accepted to Lincoln University with a broadcasting major, but decided not to go <br>
          on his first day, opting to pursue a music career full-time. He is affiliated <br>
          with the Chicago-based gang Mickey Cobras, which is known to feud with <br>
           gangs like the Gangster Disciples.

           <h3>  Career</h3>
           2018–2019: Beginnings, record deal, and Die a Legend <br>
Bartlett's first song ever recorded was titled "ODA", which he released to YouTube. Upon creating a <br>
SoundCloud account in 2018, he released the track "Gang with Me", which quickly racked up <br>
 millions of plays. He continued gaining traction with his songs "Welcome Back" and "Neva Cared". <br>
  Bartlett went on to release "Finer Things", a song he wrote while incarcerated, in the latter <br>
  half of 2018 and quickly gained millions of views. In early 2019, Bartlett released  <br>
   "Pop Out" featuring Lil Tjay which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. <br>
    The song's music video gained over 200 million views on YouTube and led to him signing a record deal <br>
    with Columbia Records. Bartlett also released videos for his songs <br>
     "Deep Wounds", "Through da Storm", "Effortless", and "Dyin' Breed" <br>
      from his debut studio album Die a Legend, which was <br>
      released on June 7, 2019, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200.[14] "Heartless", <br>
       a single released later in 2019, featured production from Mustard, and was later featured on his second album. <br>
